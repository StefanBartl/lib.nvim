---@module 'lib.nvim.system.lines'
--- Turning a subprocess's output chunks into whole lines.
---
--- Nothing that reads a process hands over lines. `vim.system`'s `stdout` /
--- `stderr` function handlers pass whatever libuv read, so a chunk can end
--- mid-line and the rest arrive in the next one. `jobstart` has the same
--- property in list form (`:h channel-lines`): the first element of a callback
--- continues the last element of the previous one. Code that splits each chunk
--- on its own therefore cuts those lines in two -- measured on 4000 lines of
--- output: 4026 entries, 26 of them malformed.
---
--- The trailing CR goes too, and that is not optional either. `vim.system`'s
--- `text = true` normalizes CRLF only for the stdout it captures *itself* --
--- it does not cover a function handler, so passing it alongside one reads
--- like a guarantee that never applied. On Windows every line would otherwise
--- carry a CR.
---
--- The trailing partial is held in memory until its newline arrives, with no
--- bound: output that never emits one accumulates in full. That is inherent to
--- line buffering rather than a choice made here, but it is worth knowing
--- before streaming something whose shape you do not control -- a caller that
--- needs a ceiling has to impose it on the process, not on this.
---
--- Both shapes are here because callers genuinely need both: `M.collector()`
--- when you want to pull lines out of chunks you already have, `M.buffered()`
--- when you want a ready-made `vim.system` handler that calls you per line.
--- The second is built on the first.

---A line collector: feed it output chunks, get whole lines back.

---delivers first, producing a line that existed in neither.

---Blank lines are returned as `""` rather than dropped: whether an empty line
---means anything is the caller's question, not this module's.
