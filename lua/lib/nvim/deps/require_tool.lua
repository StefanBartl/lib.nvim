---@module 'lib.nvim.deps.require_tool'
--- The failure moment: a command is running, the tool it needs is not here,
--- and *this* is when the user finds out.
---
--- Everything else in `lib.nvim.deps` is forward-looking — `:checkhealth`,
--- the first-run popup, `:Lib deps show` all answer "what might I need?".
--- They are read before anything breaks, which is to say: usually not at
--- all. The moment that actually reaches the user is the one where a
--- keypress does nothing, and until this module existed that moment was
--- served by whatever string each call site happened to have written by
--- hand:
---
---   "curl not found"                          -- language.nvim
---   "curl executable not found on PATH"       -- diff.nvim
---   "tesseract not found — see :checkhealth images"
---
--- The third is the best of them and still only points at another plugin's
--- health check. Meanwhile the plugin's own `docs/install.json` holds a
--- one-sentence `why`, a package name for nine package managers, and
--- everything `deps.pm` needs to compose the exact command for *this* host.
--- All of it sitting unused at precisely the moment it answers the
--- question the user now has.
---
--- So: same detection as `deps.detect`, same spec as `deps.spec`, same
--- command composition as `deps.pm` — asked at a different time.
---
---   local curl = require("lib.nvim.deps").require_tool("language.nvim", "curl")
---   if not curl then return end
---   -- ... use `curl` as the binary name
---
--- **It returns the name, not a boolean.** A tool that declares
--- `bin_alternatives` is `gs` on Linux and `gswin64c` on Windows, and a
--- caller that has just been told "yes, it's here" still has to know which
--- spelling to spawn. Returning the found name answers both questions at
--- once, and stays truthy for the `if not ... then return end` guard that
--- is the whole point.
---
--- **Nothing here installs anything**, in keeping with the rest of the
--- module: the message names the command and points at `:Lib deps install`,
--- which is still the only route that touches the system, still
--- confirmation-gated. Offering to install *at* the failure moment would be
--- answering a question the user did not ask — they wanted to translate a
--- paragraph, not administer their machine.

---How long a given (plugin, tool) pair stays quiet after being reported.
---
---This is a burst guard, not a mute. A caller that checks one tool per file
---across a 200-file batch would otherwise produce 200 identical

---it again a minute later has deliberately asked a second time and should
---be told a second time. A short window separates those two cases without
