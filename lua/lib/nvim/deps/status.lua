---@module 'lib.nvim.deps.status'
--- Every declared tool, across every plugin that declares one, in a single
--- report.
---
--- `:Lib deps show <plugin>` answers "what does *this* plugin want", which
--- is the right question once you already suspect a plugin. It is the wrong
--- question after `git clone`ing a config onto a new machine, where the
--- question is "what is missing *here*" and the existing answer was to run
--- `show` once per plugin and hold the results in your head. `:Lib deps
--- show` with no argument didn't help either: it lists the plugins that
--- ship a spec, not what any of them is missing.
---
--- **It also fixes a timing problem it doesn't look like it fixes.** The
--- first-run popup rides on a plugin's `setup()`, so a lazy-loaded plugin
--- shows it whenever it first happens to load — which for a plugin bound to
--- a rare filetype can be weeks after installation. Measured against the
--- config this library was extracted from: 120 plugins configured, 44
--- loaded at startup, 76 pending. `spec.find` already reads lazy.nvim's
--- registry, so all 76 are reachable from here — this report sees them
--- without waiting for any of them to load.
---
--- **Rendering is `deps.view`'s, unchanged.** Merging the plugins produces
--- one tool list and one `Lib.Deps.ParseResult`, which is exactly what
--- `view.show` already takes — so the popup, the `i` / `I` install keymaps,
--- the live output streaming and the `[missing]` → `[ok]` flip all work
--- here for free, rather than existing twice in slightly different forms.
--- The only thing this module really does is the merge.

---Merge one plugin's tool into the accumulating set, keyed by `bin`.
---
---The interesting case is a tool several plugins want — `curl` is declared
---by three. It has to appear once (a report listing it three times buries
---what else is missing) while still saying who wants it, so the merge is
---per-field rather than last-one-wins:
---
--- * `required` is true if *any* declarer needs it: the strictest claim is
---   the honest one, since installing it satisfies everyone and skipping it
---   breaks at least that plugin outright.
--- * `pkg` maps are unioned, first declaration winning a key. Two plugins
---   naming different packages for one binary is a bug in one of them, and
---   silently preferring the later one would hide it.
--- * `bin_alternatives` are unioned: a spelling that counts as "found" for
---   one plugin counts for all of them, since it is the same program.
--- * `why` keeps the first declarer's sentence. Concatenating several would
---   produce a paragraph per tool and bury the list; `see` names everyone.
