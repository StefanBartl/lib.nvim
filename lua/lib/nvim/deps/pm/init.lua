---@module 'lib.nvim.deps.pm'
--- OS package-manager detection and install-command composition.
---
--- Answers "which package manager does this host have" and "what would the
--- command to install these packages look like on it" — nothing more. This
--- module never executes anything; `lib.nvim.deps.install` is what puts a
--- composed command in front of the user, and even that only ever hands it
--- to a terminal buffer the user submits themselves.
---
--- Two deliberate omissions, both safety-motivated:
---
--- * **No `-y`/`--noconfirm`.** The composed commands keep the package
---   manager's own confirmation prompt. The user is going to run this in a
---   visible terminal anyway; letting apt/dnf/pacman show what they're about
---   to pull in is strictly better than suppressing it for tidiness.
--- * **No elevation logic beyond prefixing `sudo`.** On Linux that prefix is
---   the whole mechanism; on Windows, elevation is the package manager's own
---   business (winget's UAC prompt, choco's elevated-shell requirement) and
---   this module does not try to arrange it.
