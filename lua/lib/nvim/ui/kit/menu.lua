---@module 'lib.nvim.ui.kit.menu'
--- Menu component: an anchored action list. Each item pairs a label with a
--- callback; picking an item runs its callback. Built on the native chooser
--- (lib.nvim.ui.kit.chooser), so it inherits themed selection and the same
--- navigation (j/k/arrows, <CR>, <Esc>/q).
---
--- It accepts two item shapes, because it doubles as the native renderer for
--- `lib.nvim.contextmenu` (see that module's `renderer` option):
---
--- - the kit's own `{ label = "Do X", action = fn }`, and
--- - nvzone/menu's `{ name = "Do X", cmd = fn, rtxt = "<leader>x", hl = … }`,
---   including `{ name = "separator" }` dividers and nested fly-outs
---   (`{ name = "Git", items = { … } }`, or `items = "gitsigns"` for one of
---   nvzone/menu's own `menus.*` tables).
---
--- Nesting is a **drill-down**, not a side-by-side fly-out: picking a nested
--- entry replaces the current list with its children (the chooser is a single
--- active instance). Every level below the top opens with a `Back` entry, and
--- `<BS>` does the same thing from the keyboard — a menu reached by
--- <RightMouse> has to be leavable with the mouse too. That drill-down is the
--- one behavioural difference from nvzone/menu, which opens the child in a
--- second window beside the parent.
---
--- # Layout
---
--- A row is a set of fixed-width columns, measured across the **whole** level
--- rather than per group, so everything lines up regardless of which section
--- an entry sits in:

---
--- The leading glyph is an `icon` **field**, not part of `label`. That
--- distinction is the whole point: a glyph baked into the label string is
--- just text, so an item that has one is indented past every item that does
--- not, and one contributor's `"  Open"` (two spaces where a glyph was meant
--- to be — a real bug, found twice in this codebase) silently shifts a whole
--- section out of line. As a column, an icon is either present or blank, and
--- the labels align either way. `label_of` also trims, so a stray leading
--- space cannot reintroduce the problem from a caller this module does not
--- own.
---
--- # Groups
---
--- Items are partitioned into groups by `{ name = "separator" }` and by
--- heading markers (`{ __heading = true, name = "Clipboard" }`, produced by
--- `lib.nvim.contextmenu.heading`). How a group is drawn is `group_style`:
---
--- - `"box"` (default) — a titled frame per group, so a section reads as one
---   thing rather than as a run of rows between two thin lines. A level with
---   no group titles at all falls back to `"plain"`: an untitled frame says
---   nothing a divider does not, and a caller that never named its sections
---   keeps exactly the look it had.
--- - `"header"` — a titled rule above each group, no frame.
--- - `"plain"` — the pre-group look: a divider line between groups, and a
---   title (if any) as an inert heading row.

local ICON_GAP = 1

--- Columns between the label column and the submenu marker.
---
--- The marker follows the **label** column, not the row. Pushed to the right
--- edge it sits a long way from the text it belongs to and starts reading as
--- part of the frame; parked just past the longest label it stays attached to
--- the list -- which, in a menu that also carries keymap hints, puts it at
--- roughly two thirds of the width. The hint column keeps the right edge,
--- where a key is looked for.
local MARKER_GAP = 2

--- Columns of empty space at each edge of a row, so labels and `rtxt` hints
--- don't sit flush against the border. nvzone/menu spends the same budget
--- differently -- one leading space plus an `item_gap` of 5 added to the
--- window width -- but the effect it is after is this one: air around the
--- text. Since the menu passes its own width (see `open_level`), the padding
--- has to be part of the row, not slack left over in the window.
local PAD = " "

--- Marker on an entry that opens a nested list. It gets a column of its own
--- and the theme's accent, rather than trailing the label as plain text: a
--- fly-out is the one thing in a menu that says "this does not run, it goes
--- deeper", and it used to be the least visible mark on the row.
---
--- An arrow with a shaft, not a bare triangle: at one cell a triangle reads
--- as a bullet, and the shaft is what makes the direction the first thing you
--- see.
---
--- Plain Unicode, not a Nerd Font glyph: a menu that has to render on any
--- terminal is the wrong place to require a patched font. `submenu_marker`
--- overrides it if the default measures wide in a given terminal.
