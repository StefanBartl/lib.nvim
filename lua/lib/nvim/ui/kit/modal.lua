---@module 'lib.nvim.ui.kit.modal'
--- Which modal kit dialogs are open right now, and a way to be told when none is.
---
--- A dialog that takes the keyboard (confirm, input, select, sheet, ...) registers its surface
--- through `surface.open{ modal = true }`; the registry forgets it when the float closes, for any
--- cause. `kit.ask` uses it to wait for a free moment without looking again every few hundred
--- milliseconds: it subscribes once with `on_free` and is called when the last modal dialog went.
---
--- A dialog that has gone but whose answer is still on its way (confirm answers an externally
--- closed float on the next loop iteration) holds the registry busy with `hold()` until it has
--- been delivered, so a waiting question never opens between the close and that answer.
---
--- Nothing here owns a window or a keymap. A float closed without `WinClosed` (never in practice)
--- is dropped from `busy()` as soon as it is looked at, and the subscribers are woken by the next
--- close.

--- Wake the subscribers when nothing is open. Each is called once, in the order it subscribed, on
--- the next loop iteration (a close runs inside `WinClosed`, where opening a float is restricted).
--- The check is made again when they run: something may have opened or been held in between, and
--- then they stay subscribed, ahead of anyone who subscribed since.
