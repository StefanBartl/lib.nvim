---
--- Recorded rather than catalogued by hand, for the reason
--- `lib.nvim.bindings.autocmd` spells out at its own registry: a hand-kept list
--- is a mirror, and mirrors drift.
---
--- `nvim_get_commands()` already answers "what commands exist", so the point
--- here is the half it cannot: **where each one was created**. "Something
--- defines `:CwdHere`" is not an answer a reader can act on without the file.
---
--- The composer keeps its own registry for verb trees (`:Verb sub ARG`); this
--- one is for the plain `create()` calls, which had nothing.

--- callback, `desc`/`nargs` defaults) and optional buffer-local registration.
