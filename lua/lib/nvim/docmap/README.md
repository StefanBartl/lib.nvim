# `lib.nvim.docmap`

Generates a **module map** from an annotated Lua tree: scan → IR → check →
render. Doxygen-shaped, but scoped to the part that is actually useful for a
Lua utility library — hierarchy, module purpose, links, and drift detection.

The generated map for this repo lives in [`docs/map/`](../../../../docs/map/):
[`index.html`](../../../../docs/map/index.html) (interactive) and
[`overview.md`](../../../../docs/map/overview.md) (renders on GitHub).

## Usage

```vim
:LibMap              " regenerate the artifacts
:LibMap check        " verify without writing; findings go to the quickfix list
:LibMap open         " open the generated HTML in the system browser
```

```bash
nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua               # regenerate
nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua --check       # verify: stale or drift -> exit 1
nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua --check --lenient  # fail on staleness only
```

The `:LibMap` command is opt-in — call `require("lib.nvim.docmap.command").setup()`
to register it. Requiring `lib.nvim.docmap` alone never creates a command.

## Using it for another plugin

Nothing outside [`config.lua`](config.lua) knows lib.nvim's layout. Another
plugin points docmap at its own tree:

```lua
require("lib.nvim.docmap").generate({
  root = "/path/to/my-plugin",
  source = "lua/myplugin",
  lua_root = "lua",
  title = "myplugin.nvim",
  out_dir = "docs/map",
  repo_url = "https://github.com/me/my-plugin",
})
```

The only requirement on the tree is that files carry `---@module`. Everything
else — module prefix, directory layout, types directory name — is an option.

## Pipeline

| Stage | Module | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| Scan | [`scan.lua`](scan.lua) | `Lib.Docmap.IR` — hierarchy, summaries, links |
| Check | [`check.lua`](check.lua) | `Lib.Docmap.Finding[]` — documentation drift |
| Render | [`render/`](render/) | HTML, Markdown, Mermaid |
| Encode | [`json.lua`](json.lua) | deterministic JSON |

The IR is the contract between the halves: renderers never touch the
filesystem, and the scanner never knows what will be drawn. Adding an output
format means writing one function against the IR.

### What the scanner does *not* do

It does not parse Lua. It reads each file's leading comment block — everything
before the first non-comment line — and stops. That is reliable here because
`---@module` coverage in this tree is 226/226, and it costs ~200 lines instead
of a Lua front end.

The consequence: docmap knows *that* a module exists and what it says about
itself, not what its functions are. For the full type surface,
`lua-language-server --doc` already emits exactly that as `doc.json`; merging
it in is a planned enrichment, not a rewrite.

## Structure of the map

| Node kind | What it is |
|---|---|
| `module` | A directory containing `init.lua` |
| `namespace` | A directory without `init.lua`, grouping others |
| `file` | A non-`init.lua` Lua file |

Helper files stay visible as leaves rather than being folded into their
parent — `find_upward_dir/matcher.lua` is real, documented, and worth finding.
A `@types/` directory is an **attribute** of its module, not a sibling node:
types belong to the thing they type, and promoting them doubles the tree for
no navigational gain.

## Drift checks

The rendered map is the visible half; the checks are the half that catches
bugs. Generic checks (any annotated Lua tree):

| Check | Severity | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `missing-module-tag` | error | A source file with no `---@module`. |
| `module-path-mismatch` | error | Declared `@module` ≠ where the file lives — copy-pasted or stale headers. |
| `missing-summary` | warn | `@module` present but no description line. |
| `dead-readme-link` | warn | A relative link in a README pointing at nothing. |
| `missing-readme` | info | Module without a README — should be a decision, not an accident. |
| `unreferenced-module` | info | Required by no other file in the tree. |

Repo-specific checks are passed in via `opts.extra_checks`. lib.nvim adds one:

| Check | Severity | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `type-not-exported` | error | A `---@field` on the aggregate `Lib` class that does not resolve at runtime. |

That last one exists because `lib.find_root` was declared on the `Lib` class
and wired into none of the export strategies — the published type was simply
false, and it was found by accident. The check resolves against
`require("lib")` rather than by scanning the strategy sources: an early regex
version produced a false positive on `json_decode_to_string_array`, which is
wired through `SPECIAL_HANDLERS` in a shape the pattern did not match.
Indexing the real table is ground truth.

## Determinism

Two decisions make `--check` possible:

- **No timestamp in the IR.** A `generated_at` field would make every
  regeneration a diff even when nothing changed.
- **Sorted-key JSON** via [`json.lua`](json.lua), not `vim.json.encode`, whose
  object key order is unspecified. Without it, two runs over an unchanged tree
  produced byte-different files and `--check` reported the map as stale
  immediately after generating it.

Output is byte-identical across runs on unchanged input.

## Why `--check` does not regenerate

A hook that regenerates and stages output produces diffs the author never
intended, and interacts badly with `--amend` and rebase. `--check` fails with
"module map is stale — run `:LibMap`" and leaves regeneration explicit.

`--check` fails on both staleness and error-severity drift. Enforcing drift
was originally opt-in, because the tree carried a backlog of it and a check
that is red before anyone touches anything gets disabled. That backlog is
cleared, so enforcement is the default and `--lenient` is the escape hatch.

## Git hook

```bash
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks   # once per clone
```

[`scripts/hooks/pre-commit`](../../../../scripts/hooks/pre-commit) runs
`--check` when `lua/`, `docs/map/` or the generator changed, and prints the
findings plus the one command that fixes them. It never regenerates or stages
anything itself. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`.
