---@module 'lib.nvim.async'
--- Minimal coroutine async/await over libuv, plus the two control
--- primitives that need it (`Semaphore`, `Condvar`), plus `LatestWins`, a
--- "newest request wins" token gate for overlapping async work.
---
--- The whole thing rests on one protocol: `await(starter)` yields the
--- `starter` function, and the driver in `run()` calls `starter(resume)`.
--- Whatever `resume` receives becomes `await`'s return values. A libuv
--- callback is passed straight through as `resume`; a semaphore waiter is
--- just a stored `resume` called later. No promise/future objects, no
--- scheduler beyond `step()`.
---
--- Written against real duplication rather than speculatively: this is
--- the extraction of the private `await`/`run_async` helper that
--- `fs.collect_recursive` and `fs.write.async` each carried their own
--- (already diverging) copy of.
---
--- Neovim-side by design, not `lib.lua`: `run`'s completion and error
--- paths must hop through `vim.schedule`, because every resume after the
--- first happens inside a raw libuv callback (fast-event context) where
--- `vim.fn`/`vim.api` are off limits. `Semaphore`/`Condvar` are pure
--- coroutine mechanics, but only mean anything under this runner, so they
--- live here too.

-- =========================================================

--- Suspend the running coroutine until `starter` settles. `starter(resume)`
--- must arrange for `resume(...)` to be called — typically by passing it
--- straight through as a libuv callback. Whatever `resume` receives becomes
--- this call's return values. Only valid inside a coroutine driven by
--- `M.run`.
---@param starter fun(resume: fun(...))
---@return ... # whatever `resume` was called with
function M.await(starter)
  return coroutine.yield(starter)
end

--- Drive a coroutine written against `M.await` to completion.
---
--- `on_done` receives `body`'s return values (all of them, embedded `nil`s
--- included) and is `vim.schedule`-dispatched — every resume past the
--- first happens inside a raw libuv callback, so nothing after the last
--- `await()` may safely touch `vim.fn`/`vim.api` without that hop.
---
--- An error thrown inside `body` does not propagate to the original
--- caller (its stack is long gone by then); it goes to `opts.on_error`,
--- which defaults to a `vim.notify` prefixed with `opts.tag` so it lands
--- in `:messages` instead of vanishing into the event loop.

--- Note that `:release()` resumes a waiting coroutine *synchronously*,

--- between a release and the acquire it unblocks) at the cost of nesting
--- the resumed coroutine's stack under the releasing one.

-- Bounded fan-out
-- =========================================================

--- Run a callback-style `worker` over every item with **at most `limit` of
--- them in flight**, collect the results in item order, and tell the caller
--- when the last one finished (or when it stopped the run).
---
--- The shape every "do this for each of N repositories/files/servers" feature
--- hand-builds: start `limit` jobs, start the next one whenever one finishes,
--- count down, call back. It exists once here because the hand-built copies
--- each get a different corner wrong -- re-entrancy (a worker that finishes
--- synchronously), a throwing worker that stalls the run, a late result after
--- the caller gave up.
---
--- `worker(item, index, done)` starts the work for one item and must call
--- `done(result, err)` **exactly once** when it is finished (a second call is
--- ignored). It may return a handle with a `stop()` method -- what
--- `run_async_captured` and the `*_async` helpers of `lib.nvim.git` return --
--- so `stop` on the run can kill whatever is still in flight. A worker that
--- *throws* counts as finished with that error; it neither stalls the run nor
--- escapes into the caller. A worker that never calls `done` stalls the run,
--- as it would any hand-built pool.
---
--- `on_progress` (after every finished item) and `on_done` are
--- `vim.schedule`d, in the order the events happened, so they are always safe
--- to use `vim.api` in. `worker` is not: it is called synchronously -- for the
--- first `limit` items from inside this function, for the rest from whichever
--- call of `done` freed a slot, i.e. in the context `done` was called from.
--- That is the main loop for `run_async_captured` and every `*_async` helper
--- (they all `vim.schedule` their callback); a worker driven by a raw libuv
--- callback must not touch `vim.api` itself.
---
--- `on_done(results, errors, stopped)`: `results[i]` and `errors[i]` belong to
--- `items[i]` (both sparse: a successful item has no error, a failed one
--- usually no result). After `stop()` they hold what had finished by then,
--- `stopped` is `true`, and anything finishing later is discarded.
